      I have an  address to give  viewers wanting  to send  donations  to the channel. But, it is not public.
      You can say in \#channel that you have something you want to send  or send me a DM. If it is something I can 
      take (I have limited space) then I'll send you the address in a DM. 
      
      Please don't ask if I can repair something for you. It's an uncomfortable situation with possible liabilities I do not want. 
      Two way shipping especially. It's not a matter of cost or time I just don't want that responsibility.

      I'm not able to accept every single server member's friend request. So please do not ask if I will accept your
      request. The only fair way to handle them is to not accept any.
